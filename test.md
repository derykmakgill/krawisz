title: The Great Bitcoin Scaling Debate — An Annotated Timeline
---

This is a long, working document that is nowhere near complete. I attempt to show through a chronology of primary source material that Bitcoin was systematically hijacked and directed against its original vision of scaling on-chain. 

I do not claim that scaling on-chain is the proper way to scale Bitcoin, only that it was the way *intended* by Satoshi Nakamoto and early Bitcoiners, and that technical and economic arguments against scaling on-chain played a less important role in the eventual outcome than censorship, propaganda, etc.

#### 29 October 1995

In a discussion about Digicash on the Cypherpunk Mailing List, 
James A. Donald [critisizes](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) 
the early electronic cash for having high fees.

>While Chaum is a brilliant cryptographer, he is an incompetent businessman
>
>He has demonstrated this in numerous ways.
>
>The latest being "Cash" where the bank skims off 4% to 10% every time.
>
>No one is going to use digicash under these kinds of terms and 
conditions.

#### 30 Oct 1995

Creator of the Cypherpunk Mailing List Timothy C. May [responds](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) 
in agreement.

>I don't know if the "skims off 4% to 10% every time" point accurately
describes how the current Digicash model works, but certainly this will not
fly as a long term rate. So many monetary transactions happen in the course
of business that even a 4% fee _per transaction_ would rapidly wipe out
most of the value.

#### 14 June 1996

Hal Finney argues for the [utility of online micropayments](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1996/06/b2345507ef1258011af9ea463ae9b03714f5cd29c4092458bd0002b360f1d545/) on the Cypherpunk Mailing List.

>Consider two sites, one which acts as a proxy and cache but which
charges something under a penny per page, and another which acts for
free.  Won't the for-pay site be able to afford a larger disk, more
servers, and better net connections?  It will be a superior service.
>
>Micropayments will allow new services and improved quality over what we
have today where we have to rely on charity and advertising as
motivations for much of what we find on the web.

#### 02 May 1997

Blockstream founder and Hashcash inventor Adam Back [writes](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1997/05/ef17e389556d2b6e27e8e0036a85ce1fedc73e2de871cc30728e7fc8be3d7f09/) 
on the Cypherpunk Mailing List that a successful digital cash project must be ultra low cost to transact with.

>What we want is fully anonymous, *ultra low transaction cost,* transferable units of exchange.  If we get that going the banks will become the obsolete dinasaurs they deserve to become.

#### May 1999

Nick Szabo publishes [*Micropayments and Mental Transaction Costs.*](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/micropayments-and-mental-transaction-costs.pdf) The paper argues against the viability of online micropayments and suggests security is a more important investment than reducing network resource usage to enable cheaper transactions.

>A lesson for micropayment efforts is that mental costs usually exceed, and
often dwarf, the computational costs. Reductions in the per transaction computational costs of transactions may often be economically insignificant. Other transaction costs addressable by hardware or software, such as security concerns,
as well as costs of better communicating product quality versus price tradeoffs
in the user interface, are usually more important ob jectives for technological
cost reduction than conserving on computational or network resources.

#### 22 January 2006

Future Blockstream Cofounder Greg Maxwell is [accused of vandalism, bullying, terrorist sympathizing, sockpupettry and more on Wikipedia.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/45ail1/wikipedians_on_greg_maxwell_in_2006_now_cto_of/)

>(Copied from WP:AN/3RR, because there were edits that amounted to vandalism, as well as excessive reverting)
>
>He has reverted Template:User freedom seven times despite repeated calls to stop from multiple editors. The version he is reverting to is far different from what the creators and users intended it for. I consider these edits to be an act of vandalism.

>I'm also surprised by the length of the block, because he was engaged in vandalism, not just edit warring. I'd block him myself but I was involved in a dispute with him over an image recently. Three examples of the edits I see as vandalism: he changed a box supporting the American military to one supporting the Iraqi insurgents. He inserted an image of a woman "hogtied" and gagged into a box opposing fox hunting, and changed the fox hunting link to BDSM. On Template:Wikiproject Terrorism, he replaced the image of a terrorist with one of a nuclear explosion.  

>Alert to all admins. Gmaxwell is going around to every user page that displays any kind of thumbnail or flag from Wikipedia Commons and declaring them "copyright violation". He is then blanking the user page and putting up a copyright violation notice. Is there any justification for this?

>Yes, I inadvertently fell foul of that a while ago. On that occasion, though, the person who alerted me merely removed the image and left me a polite note in explanation. Gmaxwell has for some time been behaving very oddly and aggressively with regard to image violations (real or occasionally imagined). Here, he's misapplying a rule about fair-use images to the use of public-domain images, and doing so in a heavy-handed manner.

>I've spoken to him several times about his aggression, since a dispute I had with him recently about an image (in which he called me "hysterical" and accused me of vandalism because I dared to revert his removal of it). What with this today and his behavior last night (see above), I'm unsure of the best way is to proceed, but something needs to happen.

>His behaviour is outrageous. Firstly, where fairuse images are wrongly on user pages it is invariably due to a misunderstanding, not an attempt to break the law. All he had to do was leave a message, not post a massive notice all but accusing the user of being a lawbreaker. Secondly, he is not removing the offending image, but all images, even those that can be displayed. Thirdly, blanking a user's page is grossly disrespectful to other users. Frankly, he is out of control at this stage. This bullying behavour of his has to stop.

>I move that all his edits be reverted and considered petty vandalism, and that the said user be blocked for a period of one week. We don't have time to entertain him or his dubious edits.

>OK, his contribs list is beyond the pale. It's vandalism, pretty clearly.

>On the evidence, it seems that Majorityrule was a sockpuppet of Gmaxwell. I have extended Maxwell's block to one week. Given his behaviour, if they are an admin perhaps a move should be made to have them desysoped.

>He isn't an admin and supeficially performing exactly the same set of edits does suggest a sock puppet (my initial reaction), though of course it's possible that it is someone up to mischief.

>He's not known for making "reasonable, patient attempts to protect the Foundation," unfortunately, but for acts of aggression that have led other users to leave the project. I'm concerned that, in his most recent statements, he has announced his intention to continue being disruptive, and has said he'll evade any blocks that are applied. That's a direct threat to the project, not an attempt to protect it.

>Today he seemed to indicate he has no intention of following our policies:
>
>"Like I give a crap about being blocked, it doesn't even inhibit me from editing."
>
>"Man. You think I've stopped because I'm blocked? Please! Blocking doesn't actually stop anyone but twits!" 
>
>"You're still wrong about me being blocked accomplishing *anything*, since I can still edit whenever I please... in fact, being blocked gives me far less incentive to be nice about it, in so far as there can be far less than nearly none at all."
>
>"I feel great because I can still do what I want, and I don't have to worry what rude jerks think about me ... I can continue to do whatever I think is right without the burden of explaining myself to a shreaking [sic] mass of people." 
>
>That's not even to mention the personal attacks.

>My opinion of this user is that he is a very dangerous individual whose edits speak for themselves. Full of sarcasm, threats, rude insults, impersonations of an admin, not to mention massive disprect of other users and blanking of user pages. I'm all about forgiving, but this is banable behavior. If further incidents occur, a ban would be warranted. 

#### 14 July 2010

A <code>max_block_size</code> [value of 1MB](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/a30b56ebe76ffff9f9cc8a6667186179413c6349#diff-118fcbaaba162ba17933c7893247df3aR2614) set on the client.

#### 22 July 2010

The Bitcoin.org website on [Wayback Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20100722094110/http://www.bitcoin.org:80/) lists the main advantages of Bitcoin on the homepage. In bold, it says:

> Bitcoin transactions are practically free, whereas credit cards and online payment systems typically cost 1-5% per transaction plus various other merchant fees up to hundreds of dollars.

#### 19 September 2010

After some discussion, Hal Finney, Satoshi (Bitcoin’s creator), and the user ‘Cryddit,’ who is Ray Dallingerr, on Bitcointalk imposed a [1MB default block size](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/172f006020965ae8763a0610845c051ed1e3b522) to reduce the chance of spam transactions hijacking blockspace, or the possibility of cheap DoS attacks. [Cryddit below explains why this limit was put in place:](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=946236.msg10388435#msg10388435)

>I'm the guy who went over the blockchain stuff in Satoshi's first cut of the bitcoin code.  Satoshi didn't have a 1MB limit in it. The limit was originally Hal Finney's idea.  Both Satoshi and I objected that it wouldn't scale at 1MB.  Hal was concerned about a potential DoS attack though, and after discussion, Satoshi agreed.  The 1MB limit was there by the time Bitcoin launched.  But all 3 of us agreed that 1MB had to be temporary because it would never scale.
>
>Several attempted "abuses" of the blockchain under the 1MB limit have proved Hal right about needing the limit at least for launching purposes.  A lot of people wanted to piggyback extraneous information onto the blockchain, and before miners (and the community generally) realized that blockchain space was a valuable resource they would have allowed it.  The blockchain would probably be several times as big a download now if that limit hadn't been in place, because it would have a lot of random 1-satoshi transactions that exist only to encode information for altcoins etc.
>
>At this point I don't think random schmoes who would allow just any transaction are getting a  lot of blocks. The people who have made a major investment in hashing power are doing the math to figure out which tx are worthwhile to include because block propagation time (and therefore the risk of orphan blocks) is proportional to block size. So at this point I think blockchain bloat as such is no longer likely to a problem, and the 1MB limit is no longer necessary.  It has been more-or-less replaced by a profitability limit that motivates people to not waste blockchain bandwidth, and miners are now reliably dropping transactions that don't pay fees. 

#### 01 December 2010

One of the [earliest posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eef3h/a_short_introduction_to_bitcoin_a_peer_to_peer/) on r/Bitcoin is made linking to an article titlted *A Short Introduction to Bitcoin - A Peer to Peer Cryptocurrency.* The [linked article](https://bluishcoder.co.nz/2010/10/10/a-short-introduction-to-bitcoin.html) describes the author's interest in Bitcoin's ability to offer micropayments.

>I'm interested in the approach of using bitcoin as a way to do micro-transactions and ease online payments and donations.

#### 19 July 2011

r/bitcoin moderator u/AtlasLGo is [accused](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30211.0) of trying to sell r/bitcoin. In the ensuing drama, someone contacts Reddit and he is removed along with three other mods we can see on the [WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20110530125818/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/new/) as late as May 2011.

Theymos becomes the new sole [moderator](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30211.msg381922#msg381922) and refuses to allow the old ones back in. We see him as the sole moderator on the WayBack machine in [September 2011.](https://web.archive.org/web/20110927021847/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/new/)

Now former moderator u/edzillion [recounted](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/84djb8/did_theymos_purchase_rbitcoin_in_2011/dvqcdvp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) the story years later: 

>Atlas was basically inactive - it seemed the modding was going just fine (it was a very positive community in those early days) but then one day without any warning we were all kicked. It seems atlas was chatting with people over IRC and they were like how can you sell it? and he booted all the other mods in preparation for a sale.
>
>This caused a total shitstorm, as you can imagine, and the community basically shouted loud enough that the orig mod backed down and agreed to hand it over to whoever the community decided, which was theymos.
>
>Theymos wasn't much better - wouldn't re-add any of the kicked mods and held it alone himself on some kind of power trip. Things got quite unfriendly after that - partially because theymos is a typical angry asshole libertarian, and partially because the scene grew so much that it was hard to maintain a close community.
>
>After a while of lobbying to get back in and failing, I gave up on it but I still feel disabused by that situation. I put a lot of good work into making bitcoin and r/bitcoin what it is today. We were all crazy wide-eyed zealots back then shouting it from the rooftops. I figured I at least deserved some kind of explanation, let alone my modship (which, let's face it is a somewhat useful position in the btc world).

#### 30 July 2011

Greg Maxwell suggests that [Bitcoin can scale and remain decentralized.](https://web.archive.org/web/20140328052630/https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Talk:Scalability)

>When techies hear about how bitcoin works they frequently stop at the word "flooding" and say "Oh-my-god! that can't scale!". The purpose of this article is to take an extreme example, the peak transaction rate of Visa, and show that bitcoin could technically reach that kind of rate without any kind of questionable reasoning, changes in the core design, or non-existent overlays. As such, it's merely an extreme example— not a plan for how bitcoin will grow to address wider needs (as a decentralized system it is the bitcoin using public who will decide how bitcoin grows)— it's just an argument that shows that bitcoin's core design can scale much better than an intelligent person might guess at first.
>
>Dan rightly criticizes the analysis presented here— pointing out that operating at this scale would significantly reduce the decentralized nature of bitcoin: If you have to have many terabytes of disk space to run a "full validating" node then fewer people will do it, and everyone who doesn't will have to trust the ones who do to be honest. Dan appears (from his slides) to have gone too far with that argument: he seems to suggest that this means bitcoins will be controlled by the kind of central banks that are common today. His analysis fails for two reasons (and the second is the fault of this page being a bit misleading):
>
>First, even at the astronomic scale presented here the required capacity is well within the realm of (wealthy) private individuals, and certainly would be at some future time when that kind of capacity was required. A system which puts private individuals, or at least small groups of private parties, on equal footing with central banks could hardly be called a centralized one, though it would be less decentralized than the bitcoin we have today. The system could also not get to this kind of scale without bitcoin users agreeing collectively to increase the maximum block size, so it's not an outcome that can happen without the consent of bitcoin users.

#### 23 October 2014

Blockstream [announces](https://blockstream.com/2014/10/23/en-why-we-are-co-founders-of-blockstream/) itself to the world on their blog.

>...we propose technology to enable new cryptocurrency networks that do not need new cryptocurrencies (see our sidechains whitepaper for more information, as well as read an interview with the Wall Street Journal BitBeat). Delivering on this vision will require continued investment in and cooperation with the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole, along with the full-time support of many people with broad and specialized backgrounds. 

#### 06 November 2014

Early Bitcoin adopter Stefan Molyneux makes a video predicting that [Bitcoin will be taken over and the methods by which it will happen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-sMbf2OzOY&feature=youtu.be)

>Let's not kill it outright. It's big enough now that people will see what we've done. What they're going to try to do is throw little bits of sand in it until most people find it too cumbersome to use. That is the great danger. 

#### 17 November 2014

[Blockstream closes a $21M seed round.](https://blockstream.com/2014/11/17/en-blockstream-closes-21m-seed-round/) “Can’t be evil" is the informal motto.

#### 12 June 2015

Chinese miners signed a statement that they want [8MB blocks.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3a0n4m/why_upgrade_to_8mb_but_not_20mb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) Signatories included the large mining companies F2pool, BTCChina, Antpool, Huobi, and BW.

![Miners Want Big Blocks](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*3fpU-5KaDHJjXFao.)

In an article translated on Medium, the miners argue:

>If the current network is incapable of supporting blocks larger than 1MB, then Core’s insistence on the block size limit is understandable. But actually, even with the Great Firewall in place, Chinese mining pools have all said they want an 8MB block size.

#### 13 August 2015

/u/aminok has his post [(archive)](https://archive.is/E75Cx#selection-1969.95-1969.299) deleted, in which he asked the mods: “please don’t try to impose your will on the Bitcoin community.” 

>Allow posts that promote hard forks in the sub. A hard fork to raise the hard limit has been part of the development plan for Bitcoin since 2010. Posts about it are entirely appropriate for this subreddit.

He posted a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin_uncensored/comments/3gxup6/another_meta_post_deleted_in_rbitcoin_what_can_we/cu2j0ea?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) he received from the moderrators about it in an uncensored Bitcoin subreddit.

>Regarding the specific post that was removed: There have been several front-page posts about r/Bitcoin's XT-related moderation over the last few days. Your post added nothing to this discussion and was generally repetitive. See the rules:
>
>Please avoid repetition — r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem.
>
>Even if you think that something is important, you can't keep bringing it up day after day on r/Bitcoin without some significant+notable additional thoughts/news. It might get upvoted, but overall it's annoying and hurts the usability of r/Bitcoin.

#### 15 August 2015

A now [deleted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h5f90/these_mods_need_to_be_changed_upvote_if_you_agree/) post [(archive)](https://archive.is/rum9c) on /r/bitcoin calling for the moderators to step down garnered more than 2,800 upvotes (91% upvoted), making it one of the highest-voted threads of /r/bitcoin history. The community demonstrated consensus (heh) that the current /r/bitcoin mod squad was corrupt, participating in censorship, and needed to go.

One user comments the following:

>Everytime I have something to say critical of bitcoin or something nice to say about an altcoin I get banned here. These mods censor conversation. It is disingenious to censor anything that isn't pro bitcoin. Stop the circle jerk. (and yes I love bitcoin but don't censor me fucks)

Another user comments that the censorship of Bitcoin XT topics is rallying the community to push back against them.

>The comically open and heavy-handed censorship combined with simple ad hominen attacks (XT is ALTCOIN) makes this feel almost like a troll campaign for the purpose of rallying the community. We all rally against the censorship and mods by running XT. Thus quickly settling consensus rather than dragging it out over months. Maybe. Maybe

Removeddit shows [several censored comments.](http://removeddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h5f90/these_mods_need_to_be_changed_upvote_if_you_agree/)

#### 16 August 2015

Bitcoin entrepreneur Ryan Selkis asks Adam Back publicly if [he is seriously contemplating a class action lawsuit](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/633092083042099201?s=20) against Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen if they move forward with Bitcoin XT.

>@adam3us is it true you've contemplated joining a class action lawsuit against gavin & mike if they go through with the hard fork?

Adam Back [replies,](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/633093049397063680?s=20) seemingly acknowledging that he directly or indirectly supports the idea of a lawsuit to stop Bitcoin XT.

> if you lost your Bitcoins as a result of Gavin network split - would you hold him accountable?

He goes on to suggest that Gavin could be held [criminally negligent](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/633119949943275520?s=20) for supporting Bitcoin XT and compares him to Mark Karples of the infamous Mt. Gox exchange.

Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik [responds,](https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/633097876877348864?s=20) tagging Adam Back and Bitcoin Twitter personality Pierre Rochard, [who detailed](https://twitter.com/JackGavigan/status/698503931312394240?s=20) plans for a lawsuit in another Tweet:

>Turning to lawsuits implies you have lost both the tech argument and the community.

Cryptographer Ian Grigg [agrees.](https://twitter.com/iang_fc/status/633109258675073024?s=20)

>Turning to lawsuits recognises that we've lost the ability to consent as a community.

#### The same day

[Theymos announces a new censorship policy on r/Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/) that bans discussion of Bitcoin XT. The post should be read in full but some commentary is necessary.

1. Using Removeddit, [we can see that over 90 comments were censored on the post.](http://removeddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/)

2. The post is one of the most popular posts on r/bitcoin ever, with over 1,000 comments. It stands now at zero upvotes, which shows how disliked it was.

3. Theymos suggests that Bitcoin XT does not have consensus and therefore can't be Bitcoin. His reasoning in the post is that Bitcoin core developers Wladamir, Greg, and Pieter are opposed to it. Greg and Pieter are cofounders of Blockstream.

>**About XT**
>
>r/Bitcoin exists to serve Bitcoin. XT will, if/when its hardfork is activated, diverge from Bitcoin and create a separate network/currency. Therefore, it and services that support it should not be allowed on r/Bitcoin. In the extremely unlikely event that the vast majority of the Bitcoin economy switches to XT and there is a strong perception that XT is the true Bitcoin, then the situation will flip and we should allow only submissions related to XT. In that case, the definition of "Bitcoin" will have changed. It doesn't make sense to support two incompatible networks/currencies -- there's only one Bitcoin, and r/Bitcoin serves only Bitcoin.
>
>If a hardfork has near-unanimous agreement from Bitcoin experts and it's also supported by the vast majority of Bitcoin users and companies, we can predict with high accuracy that this new network/currency will take over the economy and become the new definition of Bitcoin. (Miners don't matter in this, and it's not any sort of vote.) This sort of hardfork can probably be adopted on r/Bitcoin as soon as it has been determined that the hardfork is not absolutely against the spirit of Bitcoin (inflating out-of-schedule, for example). For right now, there will always be too much controversy around any hardfork that increases the max block size, but this will probably change as there's more debate and research, and as block space actually becomes more scarce. I could see some kind of increase gaining consensus in as soon as 6 months, though it would have to be much smaller than the increase in XT for ~everyone to agree on it so soon.
>
>There's a substantial difference between discussion of a proposed Bitcoin hardfork (which was previously always allowed here, even though I strongly disagree with many things posted) and promoting software that is programmed to diverge into a competing network/currency. The latter is clearly against the established rules of r/Bitcoin, and while Bitcoin's technology will continue working fine no matter what people do, even the attempt at splitting Bitcoin up like this will harm the Bitcoin ecosystem and economy.
>
>**Why is XT considered an altcoin even though it hasn't broken away from Bitcoin yet?**
>
>Because it is intentionally programmed to diverge from Bitcoin, I don't consider it to be important that XT is not distinct from Bitcoin quite yet. If someone created a fork of Bitcoin Core that allowed miners to continue mining 25 BTC per block forever, would that be "Bitcoin" even though it doesn't split from the Bitcoin currency/network quite yet? (I'd say no.)
>
>**Can I still talk about hard fork proposals on r/Bitcoin?**
>
>Right now, not unless you have something really new and substantial to say.
>
>After this sticky is removed, it will be OK to discuss any hardfork to Bitcoin, but not any software that hardforks without consensus, since that software is not Bitcoin.
>
>**If XT is an altcoin then why aren't sidechains or Lightning altcoins?**
>
>r/Bitcoin is about the Bitcoin currency and network. Lightning allows you to move the Bitcoin currency. Sidechains are on-topic in general because they are a possibly-useful addition to the Bitcoin network. It is possible that some specific sidechains might not be on-topic -- this isn't clear to me yet.
>
>XT is programmed to create a separate currency and network, so it is not Bitcoin.
>
>**How do you know that there is no consensus?**
>
>Consensus is a high bar. It is not the same as a majority. In general, consensus means that there is near-unanimity. In the very particular case of a hardfork, "consensus" means "there is no noticeable probability that the hardfork will cause the Bitcoin economy to split into two or more non-negligible pieces".
>
>I know almost for certain that there is no consensus to the change in XT because Bitcoin core developers Wladamir, Greg, and Pieter are opposed to it. That's enough to block consensus. And it works both ways: if Gavin and Mike are strongly opposed to Pieter's BIP, then this will also block consensus on that BIP.
>
>Other than the core devs, big Bitcoin companies (especially Coinbase, BitPay, and exchanges) could block consensus, as could large groups of average users who are collectively capable of making reasonable arguments and exerting economic force (probably not just random unknown people complaining about nothing).
>
>Even though consensus is such a high bar, I think that in practice any hardfork that gets consensus among the Bitcoin Core devs and makes it into Bitcoin Core has a good chance of succeeding. But again, the developers would just be spearheading the effort, and many others could block them if necessary.
>
>**But with such a high bar, 8 MB blocks will be impossible!**
>
>If consensus can never be reached on one particular hardfork proposal, then the hardfork should never occur. Just because you want something doesn't mean that it's ever reasonable for you to hijack Bitcoin from the people who don't want it, even if your side is the majority (which it isn't in this case). This isn't some democratic country where you can always get your way with sufficient politicking. Get consensus, live without the change, or create your own altcoin.
>
>Hard forks are supposed to be hard. While some hard forks will probably be necessary in the long run, these hard forks will need to have consensus and be done properly or Bitcoin will die due to the economy being constantly shattered into several pieces, or as a side-effect of forcing through technically unsound changes that the majority of experts disagree with (like XT's 8MB block size).
>
>**Don't most experts want 8 MB blocks soon?**
>
>Not by any reasonable idea of "most experts" I can think of. For example, among people with expert flair on /r/Bitcoin, AFAIK any large near-term increase is opposed by nullc, petertodd, TheBlueMatt, luke-jr, pwuille, adam3us, maaku7, and laanwj. A large near-term increase is supported by gavinandresen, jgarzik, mike_hearn, and MeniRosenfeld. (Those 12 people are everyone with expert flair.)
>
>I've heard concerns that some experts who oppose any large near-term increase have conflicts of interest. But many of them have been expressing the same concerns for years, so it's unlikely that any recent possible conflict of interest is influencing them. Also, if they believed that increasing the max block size would help Bitcoin as a whole, what reason would they have to prevent this? I don't see the incentive.

>We don't need to trust the above list of experts, of course. But I for one have found the conservative position's arguments to be much more convincing than the huge-increase position's arguments. It's not reasonable to say, "You know a lot more than I do, and I don't see any fault in your arguments, but you must be trying to trick me due to this potential conflict of interest, so I'm going to ignore you."

Theymos goes on the cite the largely debunked email that supposedly came from Satoshi Nakamoto as evidence for his policies and says that if 90% of r/Bitcoin users disagree, 90% should leave.

>Also, someone who could be Satoshi posted here. This email address was actually used by Satoshi before he left, and the email apparently did come from that email address legitimately (not a spoof). Whether he's actually Satoshi or not, I agree with what he's saying.

>If 90% of r/Bitcoin users find these policies to be intolerable, then I want these 90% of r/Bitcoin users to leave. Both r/Bitcoin and these people will be happier for it. I do not want these people to make threads breaking the rules, demanding change, asking for upvotes, making personal attacks against moderators, etc. Without some real argument, you're not going to convince anyone with any brains -- you're just wasting your time and ours. The temporary rules against blocksize and moderation discussion are in part designed to encourage people who should leave r/Bitcoin to actually do so so that r/Bitcoin can get back to the business of discussing Bitcoin news in peace.

>...the parent post explaining theymos' policy makes no sense to me...the possibility of forking is an integral part of Bitcoin. As long as Bitcoin-XT has non-negligible support as the true Bitcoin implementation, even with nothing resembling unanimous consensus, it is a part of what Bitcoin is, and of course is on topic on a Bitcoin subreddit.

u/Petersurda, who is neutral on the blocksize question, p[oints out that the majority of people on the subreddit disagree with these policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/cu5g4xp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) and that there is clearly a double standard on the position of forks, since there had been hard forks in the past.

>What I find interesting is that it looks like the majority of this subreddit readers has a different idea about what this subreddit should be about than the moderators, judging on the downvotes they get in this thread.

The first comic listed references things Theymos himself said in the past in favor of raising the block size and suggests he may have been paid off by Blockstream to pretend otherwise.

#### 19 August 2015 

/r/bitcoin moderator /u/jratcliff63367 makes a post to [*Let’s Talk Bitcoin titled “Confessions of an /r/bitcoin moderator.”*](https://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/confessions-of-an-r-bitcoin-moderator)

He observes that r/bitcoin is a centralized communication platform that is being used to push narratives.

>When /u/theymos decided to use his centralized authority of /r/bitcoin to stifle all debate and discussion of bitcoin-xt, he violated a core principle. As a decentralized peer-to-peer network, any point of centralized control is problematic.
>
>Even though I am, for the moment, a moderator of /r//bitcoin, I hold that position solely at the discretion of its owner /u/theymos. He can remove me at any moment, and this is his right.
>
>This one single person holds absolute centralized control of the two largest communications platforms for the community to discuss the future and evolution of bitcoin.
>
>This is both a difficult and simple problem to solve at the same time. It is difficult in that the two largest forums for discussion of bitcoin are under the centralized control of a single individual. He exercises absolute power of what is, or is not, allowed to be discussed; including complete and total censorship power over the narrative in the two largest media outlets.
>
>On the other hand, anyone can move to another forum, or sub-reddit, with the click of a mouse. So simple, yet so difficult at the same time. How do you get 150,000 people to move to another sub-reddit or message forum? It’s not easy, but that is the only solution forward if the community wishes to continue a discussion about the future of bitcoin in a more open and transparent fashion.

He then argues that Theymos is wrong about his policy of calling Bitcoin XT an altcoin:

>I want to clarify some misconceptions which have been fostered over the past few days. The /r/bitcoin sub-reddit has a long history of not allowing posts about alt-coins. In general this hasn’t been super controversial.
>
>Since /r/bitcoin has a long history of removing posts on alt-coins, /u/theymos took a very strong stance that bitcoin-xt is ‘just another alt-coin’, ‘no different than dogecoin’. He first posted this to the private moderator mail and, later, posted it as a public policy for all to see.
>
>I am here to say this, loud and clear, and unequivocally, he is wrong. Either he doesn’t see the distinction, or he does, but doesn’t care.
>
>For whatever reason /u/theymos is profoundly against bitcoin-xt, or any increase in blocksize in general. This is his opinion. And, there are probably some valid arguments to be made on this point. The problem is, rather than sharing his opinion and engaging in the debate, he has shut down all debate by censoring the top two forums where the bitcoin community discusses these topics.

The entire article is worth reading but for space I've left much of it out. He closes by asking people to debate the block size openly, not through censorship.

>Bitcoin-xt is not a ‘threat’ to bitcoin. It it is an option, a choice, a candidate to be voted on. One where the community can vote on which features they want to see in bitcoin, versus those which they do not.
>
>The future of bitcoin is not in the hands /u/theymos, or any particular developer. The future is what we, as an informed community, decide as a whole. If you want to support 1mb blocks then, great, argue that point and vote by running that version of the client software but, if you want to see bitcoin scale, then do so by voting for a client which enables those rules.

#### 29 August 2015

Ten days after his anti-censorship post on Let’s Talk Bitcoin, former /r/bitcoin moderator /u/jratcliff63367 announces that he has been [removed from his role.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin_uncensored/comments/3iwzmk/so_long_and_thanks_for_all_the_fish/) In the thread, /u/theymos chimes in to explain why he removed jratcliff:

>He was going beyond just expressing a reasonable opinion. He was being particularly disrespectful and nonconstructive for a long period of time. Disagreement (even loud public disagreement) is fine, but we can’t effectively moderate without some sort of respect and trust between moderators.

/u/jratcliff63367 writes in the thread that he was removed because he suggested the Core developers may be compromised and that [a version of Bitcoin that can only have value flow through side channels would be exactly what governments want.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin_uncensored/comments/3iwzmk/so_long_and_thanks_for_all_the_fish/cuonqqu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

>I mentioned this in another post that I have since deleted. And that post is what, I believe, got me removed as moderator; since /u/theymos emailed me shortly after I made that post. The idea that the 'core-devs' 'control' bitcoin, is clearly very centralized thinking. And, where there is centralization, there is a point of attack.
>
>It is not at all unreasonable to suppose that core-devs have been contacted by the 'spooks' and are applying influence. Crippling bitcoin so that almost all of the value has to flow through side-channels and only large institutions can access the core network would be a great solution to what world governments consider as a major problem.

#### 04 September 2015

r/bitcoin moderator u/hardleft121 announces he was removed by Theymos as moderator over a week ago and 'thanked' for his services.

Theymos replies that [he will indeed ban them and is heavily downvoted.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3uu3we/bitstamp_will_switch_to_bip_101_this_december/cxi370c/)

>If they do it, then yes, they will be banned. Very disappointing. I thought that BitStamp was one of the better exchanges.

Using [Removeddit we can see that nearly 10% of the comments on the thread were censored by moderators, some of them quite popular.](http://removeddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3uu3we/bitstamp_will_switch_to_bip_101_this_december/)

One example is a [popular comment by u/KarskOhoi,](http://removeddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3uu3we/_/cxht0jq/) deleted by moderators for supporting the move away from Bitcoin Core and Blockstream.

>Good news. Time to leave Blockstream Core.

Another deleted comment reads:

>Bitcoin is not governed by Blockstream Core. They will understand this when the BIP101 fork happens.

In total, over 80 comments were removed by r/Bitcoin moderators, most of which were unfortunately deleted too quickly for the Removeeddit tool to archive.

#### 26 December 2015

Cobra makes a Github issue to [remove Coinbase from the "choose your wallet" page on Bitcoin.org](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1178) to punish them for running a Bitcoin XT node in addition to their Bitcoin Core node.

>Coinbase is now running Bitcoin XT in their production servers. XT is an contentious hard fork attempt that will create a new altcoin and split the community and blockchain should it ever go into effect. If this ever happens, Coinbase's customers may find that they no longer own any actual Bitcoin.
>
>This pull request removes Coinbase from the "Choose your Wallet" page to protect new users from being on the wrong end of a blockchain fork. Bitcoin.org should only promote Bitcoin services. Companies that use XT don't meet this criteria because they support forking off the blockchain and switching to a new incompatible currency without broad consensus.
>
>Bitcoin Core has already announced a road map to address scalability concerns. I don't see why @barmstrong feels the need to try to promote XT in this way. Almost all of the Bitcoin technical community supports the announced road map. It's not like things aren't moving forward

One Github user [comments](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1178#issuecomment-167379700) in support that Coinbase needs to be forced in line.

>ACK. We definitely need to coerce Coinbase into switching back to Bitcoin Core. If we do not take any action, we're setting a dangerous precedent where other wallets and services are allowed to break apart from the consensus.

The issue is on the whole very unpopular thought.

Bitcoin developer [Jameson Lopp comments that Bitcoin XT can become Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1178#issuecomment-167378735) and removing companies before a fork has happened is premature.

>NACK; the potential for forking does not an altcoin make. Until such time as a BIP101 fork occurs, companies running XT are definitely running Bitcoin. If a hard fork does occur, said companies may still be running Bitcoin - it would have to be judged which fork is the winner post-fork. Removing companies as "not running Bitcoin" when no fork has occurred is jumping the gun.

OB1 Cofounder [Brian Hoffman comments:](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1178#issuecomment-167456502)

>This is a god damn experiment on their part. Not compliant with the Bitcoin network? Any service allowing registrations and financial software is subject to their locales regulations and guidelines or they go to jail. Why the fuck does that preclude them from being on a list of wallets? This is why you can't give children big boy responsibilities.

Ethereum creator[ Vitalik Buterin invokes 'Poes Law:'](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/681188770813591552?s=20)

Longtime Bitcoiner Olivier Janssens says [Coinbase is being attacked](https://twitter.com/olivierjanss/status/681178084846993408?s=20) for challenging the core developers.

>@brian_armstrong Coinbase wallet removed from http://bitcoin.org because you dared to speak up against CoreDev

Despite the unpopularity of the issue, it is committed the following day and Coinbase is removed from Bitcoin.org.

#### 28 December 2015. 

A rogue /r/bitcoin mod going by the username /u/CensorshipIsTheWorst [leaked the following conversation from the /r/Bitcoin mod-mail:](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3yj7r0/coinbase_censorship/)

>from Aussiehash [M] to /r/Bitcoin sent 1 day ago https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ycayp/brian_armstrong_on_twitter_coinbase_is_now/ I’ve removed this post for now. I’m happy for other mods to reverse or otherwise.
>
>from theymos [M] via /r/Bitcoin to Aussiehash [M] sent 11 hours ago I agree with removing it because it is mainly about XT. However, AFAICT Coinbase is currently still using Bitcoin and should therefore be allowed on /r/Bitcoinfor now in general. coblee said so in the bitcoin.org pull request, and I tend to trust him. (Perhaps Cobra was unaware of coblee’s reliability, or maybe he [IMO reasonably] considered Coinbase too dangerous/incompetent/reckless to list on bitcoin.org even though they are currently using Bitcoin.)

>from StarMaged [M] via /r/Bitcoin to theymos [M] sent 5 hours ago Honestly, it seems to me that until the moment of the split, they are still a bitcoin company. They are just buying/selling two currencies at once instead of one. I am really uncomfortable with the idea that this policy would encourage companies to silently support XT and then only tell us at the last moment. Yeah, sure, remove those posts as altcoin promotion, but people outside of this subreddit should be allowed to make an informed decision without us scaring companies into censoring themselves. I feel that this is where that term “censorship” might actually be relevant, since our actions here on this issue would affect the speech of a company elsewhere out of fear of retaliation from this subreddit. Something to ponder.

A few hours later, /u/colsatre had his moderator position revoked, leading some to speculate that he was the rogue mod. /u/CensorshipIsTheWorst never posted again.

/u/colsatre wrote later under his own account critisizing Theymos for censorship and said he was removed for not following the [party line.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/40rqrd/ustarmageds_last_action_as_a_mod_was_great_but/cywu8nz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

>I didn't leave of my own volition either. Other mods, specifically theymos, weren't happy with actions I took.

>I'm not a fan of sticking around a place where dissenting opinions are liable to be removed...

>I'm one of the regulars from back then that /u/Shadered mentioned, I was a mod here on r/Bitcoin and bitcointalk for a while. Those places are no longer for me!

>He's either extremely incompetent or malicious with the way he went about it. There was no discussion with the rest of the forum staff before giving money to Slickage.
>
>I find it hard to believe that he'd be that stupid. He also refused to answer any questions about it afterwards, which leads me to believe he did something that he knew was shady.
>
>Source - Was a mod of bitcointalk at the time it happened

On an article documenting some of the censorship on r/Bitcoin over the years, he [commented:](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5cue13/john_blocke_a_brief_and_incomplete_history_of/d9zzmkq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

>Seems to be a very good and accurate write-up!

He also supported [raising the Bitcoin block size to 2mb.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5q1v0q/are_your_transactions_slow_to_confirm_then_ask/dcvseif?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

>Can't we just bump the block size to 2mb?

#### 08 January 2016

A thread in r/Bitcoin titled *Scalability issue is a red-herring* argues Bitcoin is a store of value first and by implication suggests we don't need to raise the block size. The thread has 51 comments and zero upvotes.

Theymos comments in agreement and is heavily downvoted.

>If that requires treating bitcoins like Yap stones, that's still better than what we had before Bitcoin.

u/Uber_Nick responds, questioning Theymos on deleting comments he disagrees with.

>Does "better and freer" mean users won't be banned from discussing ideas that are different than yours?

Theymos replies and is heavily downvoted.

>No one is ever banned for discussing ideas that are different than mine. Banning someone for that reason would be completely at odds with my philosophy of moderation.

Seems rational? But when we use the [Removeddit tool,](http://removeddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/404z6b/scalability_issue_is_a_redherring/) we can see 24% of the comments on the entire are removed, most of which appear to have been in response to Theymos' defense of his moderation policies.

#### 14 January 2016

[*The Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments*](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf) is published. 

>The Bitcoin blockchain holds great promise for distributed ledgers, but
the blockchain as a payment platform, by itself, cannot cover the world’s
commerce anytime in the near future.

The paper argues that in order to "achieve much higher than 47,000 transactions per second using
Bitcoin requires conducting transactions off the Bitcoin blockchain itself."

Notably, it also argues that the Lightning Network will require block size increases on Bitcoin up to 133mb in order to work properly.

>If all transactions using Bitcoin were conducted inside a network of
micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels
per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require
133 MB blocks (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per
year). Current generation desktop computers will be able to run a full node
with old blocks pruned out on 2TB of storage.

Blockstream [raises $55 Million in a Series A Funding Round,](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-startup-blockstream-raises-55-million-in-funding-round-1454518655) one of the largest investments in a Bitcoin company ever. 

AXA Ventures co-leads the round. Bitcoiners are quick to point out that the [CEO of AXA, Henri de Castries, has been the Chairman of the Bilderberg Group since 2012](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/47zfzt/blockstream_is_now_controlled_by_the_bilderberg/) and that their ties to the traditional central banking industry and political aparatus are a huge conflict of interest in a cryptocurrency that was ostensibily designed to help make them less powerful.

>They are bankers and politicians and special interest VC groups who have literally everything to lose with something like Bitcoin taking prominence over their engineered financial farce conducted over 100 years. The greatest fraud in human history as far as I am concerned.

#### 22 February 2016

Mosaic Ventures posts an article about their participation in the investment round, stating that Bitcoin is a [technocracy governed by developers.](https://www.mosaicventures.com/mosaicblog/2016/2/4/our-investment-in-blockstream)

>The governance of Bitcoin Core, like many other open source projects, is technocratic, where a handful of “core devs” (a dynamic group that includes several Blockstream team-members) deliberate the merits of various changes to the protocol, and decide how to move the puck forward, hoping to convince each other and the wider industry of their consensus. The technocracy is at least meritocratic, in the sense that the core devs are recognized -- by their peers, the community itself -- based on their significant contributions to the code.

#### 01 July 2016

Bitcoin.org co-owner 'Cobra' posts on Github that he wants to update the Bitcoin whitepaper because it confuses people. The implication is clear by the timing. Cobra did not want people to think that Bitcoin was meant to scale on-chain.

>I've been noticing that the Bitcoin paper at https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf is getting a lot of traffic (mainly from people searching for "bitcoin paper", or probably seeing it cited by other papers). Almost all the people reading the paper are probably reading it for the first time, and using it as a learning resource. However since the paper is so outdated, I believe it doesn't do a good job anymore of giving people a firm understanding of Bitcoin (at least the modern version). There is no mention of things like pools, and the Privacy and SPV sections could probably be updated.
>
>The paper links to bitcoin.org, but I feel like the Bitcoin described in the paper and the Bitcoin described on bitcoin.org are starting to diverge. At some point, I think the paper will start to do more harm than good, because it tricks people into believing they understand Bitcoin. I have seen people promote toxic and crazy ideas, and then cite parts of the paper in an effort to justify it. Academics are also regularly citing the paper and basing some of their reasoning and arguments on this outdated paper.

A user named Rudd-O [replies](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1325#issuecomment-230184015) and is strongly critical. 

>The concept of "amending a paper" written by a first party author by way of a third-party author mangling is absurd, and it is a crime in quite a few jurisdictions.
>
>Morally, I say don't lie to people by mangling the original writeup. It exists where it exists for a reason. Altering the original paper to "update it" is a perversion of the very idea of a published paper. If you want it to be updated, talk to Satoshi. He can publish a second version.

Greg Maxwell calls him a ['pseudonymous armchair provocateur'](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1325#issuecomment-230186527) and suggests that Cobra has a point and that seriuos discussion about changing the whitepaper is needed.

>In this case, Cobra pointed out that many people land on the Bitcoin whitepaper page after searching "bitcoin paper". Presumably, some of these people are just looking for a good background on Bitcoin, and for this purpose they are not that well served by the whitepaper as of its last update because it contains some inaccuracies (and a few things that eight more years of experience has taught us are easily misunderstood). 

He accuses Rudd-O of 'online violence' and refers to Bitcoin.org as Cobra's "own space."

>Here you wax on about censorship yet you see fit to make demands not just on what someone publishes on their own website, but respond with online violence to people who are simply discussing some things you don't like, in their own space. 

Greg is heavily downvoted.

Luke Dashjr [responds in support.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1325#issuecomment-230078395)

>Sounds reasonable as long as it's clear it isn't the original paper. Maybe an updated HTML version, with a clear link to the original at the top?

He is heavily downvoted.

[Theymos replies to the thread as well](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1325#issuecomment-230082608) and suggests the whitepaper be annotated to correct errors Satoshi made and misunderstandings people might have.

>Interesting suggestion. The paper is definitely outdated, and I do often see people saying "just read the whitepaper!" as if the paper is still a good way to learn about Bitcoin. On the other hand, the paper is an important piece of history. It's still an impressive document, even if not the most useful nowadays, explaining most of how Bitcoin works in only a few pages.
>
>Maybe it would be best to stick several pages of errata and explanation to the front of the PDF, but leave Satoshi's pages untouched. Having bitcoin.pdf redirect to an HTML page would also work...

He is heavily downvoted too, and a look at the entire history clearly shows the idea was wildly unpopular.

#### 26 February 2017

Miner viaBTC writes an [article](https://imgur.com/a/jbnQ1#N4hiFJU) that asks people to unsubscribe from r/bitcoin because the subreddit is censored by people who want to turn Bitcoin into a settlement layer rather than a payment network like it has always been.

It is reposted to r/bitcoin. Using Removeddit, we can see that 136 comments, over [25% of the total comments on the post, were deleted by moderators!](http://removeddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5w9e8t/viabtc_aka_bitcoin_accelerator_is_telling_people/)

The entire post is worth reading before we look at specific examples of censorship.

>ViaBTC is of the opinion that the current "Bitcoin Core + Blockstream” Bitcoin development team is not taking satisfactory steps to ensure the growth and advancement of Bitcoin in accordance with satoshi's original white paper, and is in fact actively harming the health of the Bitcoin economy by actively stifling efforts to solve some of Bitcoin’s most pressing problems.
>
>The reason why this Transaction Accelerator exists is due to problems created by Bitcoin Core’s inability and unwillingness to deliver any sort of meaningful protocol upgrade over the last several years, against the desires of the Bitcoin community at large. Those who have attempted to deliver the necessary upgrade have been vilified and silenced by Bitcoin Core and their affiliated censored media channels. Average users who dare to disagree are banned and have their comments deleted.
>
>Rather than viewing Bitcoin as a fast, affordable, and reliable payments network, as it has been for years, they aim to transform Bitcoin into what they call “a settlement layer”, defined by high fees, unreliable transactions, and a labyrinth of complex overlays that require third-party trust on top of the basic system.
>
>This development team has further prevented the ability of the Bitcoin community to freely discuss this radical change of direction by tacitly, and in some cases explicitly, supporting censorship of Bitcoin’s largest discussion forums, along with the outright banning of many prominent developers, businesses, and community members who have differences of opinion with Bitcoin Core’s current roadmap. After years of stagnation, stalling, and broken promises, it has become clear that positive change will not come from Bitcoin Core, but rather from the diverse group of alternate development teams that have emerged as a result of Core’s tactics.
>
>The following article cites many specific examples of the rampant censorship on the "r/bitcoin" sub-reddit:

>
>As efforts by the community to resolve these problems have failed, it is necessary to resolve them with a different approach:
>
>By unsubscribing to /r/bitcoin, and subscribing to sub-reddit /r/btc you take a stand against censorship.
By running an alternate implementation, such as Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Classic, you are casting a vote against the current development team.
>
>There are currently several other cryptocurrencies which perform better than Bitcoin, have more features than Bitcoin, have a more receptive and open development team than Bitcoin, and have a better upgrade path than Bitcoin. The only remaining qualities that Bitcoin has over these other cryptocurrencies are its first-mover advantage and its pre-existing network of users and infrastructure. If these qualities are not preserved, Bitcoin will continue to lose market share to competing cryptocurrencies.
>
>The current Bitcoin Core developers are rapidly eroding this last advantage with poor design choices, a failure to understand basic economic principles, and promoting censorship through their support of censored discussion forums and their vilification of forums committed to free speech.

CCN publishes an article detailing a threat made by Bitcoin Core supporter Ciphera to [attack the Bitcoin Unlimited node network.](https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-core-supporter-threatens-zero-day-exploit-bitcoin-unlimited-hardforks/)

Hours later, after a bug in the Bitcoin Unlimited node software is disclosed, developers quickly [patch the bug on Github.](https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/pull/371/files)

Bitcoin Core developer [Peter Todd tweets about the bug in the next hour](https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/841702092687450113) before the nodes are updated with the fix, an act which many considered irresponsible because it popularizes the bug to potential attackers. There are [differing accounts](https://www.ccn.com/caused-bitcoin-unlimited-node-crash/) of when whether it started before or after Peter's tweet, but at some point an attack exploiting the bug on Bitcoin Unlimited nodes begins, taking many offline.

Many on Twitter and [r/Bitcoin celebate the attack.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5zdkv3/bitcoin_unlimited_remote_exploit_crash/) A hotfix to allow Bitcoin Unlimited nodes to continue working is released and posted on r/Bitcoin, but the [post is immediately deleted by r/Bitcoin moderators.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5zeo5p/the_censorship_on_rbitcoin_is_completely_reckless/dexpzih/)

![BU Fix](http://i.imgur.com/WGNiuJ7.png)

u/TheTT [recounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5zdkv3/bitcoin_unlimited_remote_exploit_crash/dexiun0/) what happened as he observed it: 

>They actually put out a fix before this whole madness got started - the attackers got the idea from the public fix. It should also be noted that Peter Todds tweet likely made it spread around the larger community. Completely irresponsible behaviour. Doesnt make the BU code less shitty, but still. It really shows that people just want to hurt each other, not further the ecosystem.

Big-blocker Paul Wasensteiner [writes that this is an act of war against Bitcoin Unlimited](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5zeo5p/the_censorship_on_rbitcoin_is_completely_reckless/dexpzih/) and describes what he saw:

>The entire front page is them cheering about the attack on BU, yet they censor the fix.
>
>I mean, I cannot possibly comprehend how things got this way.
>
>An influential core developer announces a bug in a bitcoin client in the most public place possible, after the bug has already been fixed but has not been pushed out yet, for the sole purpose of causing as much damage as possible. A core supporter then uses the bug to attack the network and take hundreds of nodes of the network. Then the main bitcoin subreddit fills with every single post cheering that an attack has happened on the network and that it is great. Then a hotfix is released to allow bitcoin nodes to continue operating as usual, but the main bitcoin subreddit then censors the fix.
Just let that sink in a second.

An issue is open on the Bitcoin.org Github account titled [*Removal of BTC.com wallet?*](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/16600)

>BTC.com was one of the The Future of Bitcoin Conference 2017 sponsors. At the conference well known fraudster and patent troll Craig Wright attacked bitcoin users and core devs.
>
While I don't have a problem with supporting a conference that gives different opinions (e.g BU) a platform, I draw the line when they give a dangerous egomaniac a platform for his FUD and hate.
>
While this is not against the bitcoin.org wallet inclusion rules, it shows at best poor judgement and at worst the desire to harm bitcoin.
>
>Maybe I am totally out of line here but I would like to hear from BTC.com (@bitkevin) if they knew that Craig was one of the speakers and if they support his views on Bitcoin.

Cobra replies that he doesn't mind if they are [removed from the website](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1660#issuecomment-312738631) as punishment because of their association with Jihan Wu and therefore, big block efforts.

>To be clear, it isn't up to any of us. A good portion of the community
wants to keep the legacy chain. NYA signers are free to create a hard fork,
but not adding replay protection suggests intent to destroy the legacy
chain. As long as a lot of people still want the legacy chain, attempts to
destroy it will be treated as an attack on the property of all these
people. It constitutes a serious cyberattack and decisive action against
it, both technical and legal, has been prepared.

Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream Cofounder Matt Corallo submits a [filing](https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2017-06/nysearca201706-161046.htm) to the Securities and Exchange Commission to ask them to step in and protect consumers from attempts to create a new Bitcoin.

>I am Matt Corallo, a long-time developer of Bitcoin (around the 10th publicly recorded individual to contribute to the Bitcoin codebase), an expert on Bitcoin's operation, vocal Bitcoin advocate, and strong proponent of the availability of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Product (ETP).
>
>I have very grave concerns with the proposed rules for the maintaining of Bitcoin deposits and the lack of consumer protection in the event of Bitcoin Network rule changes in the current filings.
>
>As described in the S-1 filing for the "Bitcoin Investment Trust" (BIT), a "permanent fork" of Bitcoin may occur when two groups of users disagree as to the rules which define the system (its "consensus rules"). More specifically, such a "permanent fork" is likely to occur when one group of users wish to make a change to Bitcoin's consensus rules, while another group does not. This leads to two cryptocurrencies, and may lead to significant ambiguity around which should be referred to as "Bitcoin".

#### 28 September 2017

Cobra opens a Github issue for Bitcoin.org labeled [*Add Segwit2x Safety Alert.*](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1824) The alert ostensibly warns users of hostile companies, but the list includes most of the oldest, most successful Bitcoin companies, and the real goal seems to be to scare or punish these companies for their stance on Segwit 2x.


>This adds a new alert warning users about storing any BTC in Coinbase, Bitpay and Xapo. These companies continue ahead with their plan to hard fork away from consensus, and so this alert is necessary to make sure users are informed enough about the incoming threat.
>
>Thoughts? Feedback? I've tried to keep it fairly short, and I don't want this to grow into a huge complex document full of a million different things. I think the key part is to just tell people to get their coins off these dangerous services, and I think this alert accomplishes that pretty well.
>
>I've made this into a red alert because I think this incoming hard fork is possibly the greatest threat to Bitcoin, so a red warning is necessary to catch people's attention. I want as many as possible to know what these insidious companies are planning so we can prevent them quietly pushing it through. Raising awareness is key. I'm going to be suspicious of anyone changing this document in such a way as to make the issue seem like less of a danger and trying to "tone it down" without clear well thought out reasons.

The proposal is heavily downvoted on Github. Longtime Bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Vorhees [comments on Twitter:](https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/918126175758598146)

>Glad to see many of the rational comments on https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1824 regarding http://bitcoin.org's highly political message today.

#### 05 October 2017

Despite the unpopularity of Bitcoin.org's Segwit Safety Alert proposal, they [post on their blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20171028193101/https://bitcoin.org/en/posts/denounce-segwit2x) their intentions to activate the alert in the coming days, along with a blacklist of companies that includes Coinbase, BitPay, Bitcoin.com, Blockchain.com, BTC.com and more. 

They also list 'guidelines' for companies to be removed from the list. The entire article is shared below.

>On 2017-10-11 at noon (UTC), Bitcoin.org is planning to publish a banner on every page of the site warning users about the risks of using services that will default to the so-called Segwit2x1 (S2X) contentious hard fork. S2X companies will be called out by name. To ensure that we only warn users against companies that will actually put user deposits at risk, we urge all companies to publicly clarify their stance before the above date, either by a highly-visible public statement or by commenting on Bitcoin.org issue #1835 (or by doing both).
>
>In particular, we need to know that:
>
>- The company will not under any circumstances list “Segwit2x” as “BTC” and/or “Bitcoin”. Note that Bitcoin is not ruled by miners, and miner actions cannot be used as a justification to redefine Bitcoin.
>
>- The company will not by default do anything that would deprive users of their bitcoins (by eg. using S2X software without addressing replay attacks2, selling user bitcoins automatically, crediting BTC deposits only as S2X deposits, etc.). Providing access to S2X-coins is acceptable, however.
>
>- The company will continue to provide normal service to Bitcoin (ie. non-S2X) users.
>
>Although bitcoin.org condemns contentious hard fork attempts such as S2X, we consider it tolerable for companies to support S2X in ways that do not contradict the above three points, such as by supporting both Bitcoin and S2X simultaneously as separate cryptocurrencies.
>
>By default, we will be using the following list of companies known to support S2X in our warning:

>1. “SegWit2x” has nothing to do with SegWit. SegWit is already activated, and was supported by an entirely different set of people.

The article is notable for many reasons, particularly the claim that "Segwit2x has nothing to do with Segwit."

[The Segwit Safety Alert activates on Bitcoin.org.](https://web.archive.org/web/20171029022533/https://bitcoin.org/en/) A red banner stating *Beware of Bitcoin's possible incompatibility with some major services* appears on every page.

![Segwit Safety Alert](https://i.imgur.com/Ghe8T21.png)

The linked article is shared in full below.

> **Summary**
>
>A subsection of the Bitcoin economy including prominent businesses such as Coinbase, Xapo, and BitPay have signed an agreement to adopt and implement a contentious hard fork of Bitcoin sometime in November. A hard fork is a backwards incompatible change to the Bitcoin network. This hard fork is not supported by the majority of the Bitcoin users and developers and is therefore a contentious hard fork. By adopting this hard fork, we believe the supporters of this agreement are shifting their users to an alternative currency (an altcoin) which is incompatible with Bitcoin.
>
>The signatories of this agreement wrongly believe that the currency created by adopting this contentious hard fork will eventually become Bitcoin. Therefore storing any BTC on services such as Coinbase, Bitpay and Xapo is strongly not recommended. By storing BTC on these services, you could find that after the hard fork, your BTC has been renamed to something else or replaced entirely with the new altcoin. The best way to ensure that your BTC is protected is to download the latest version of Bitcoin Core and transfer out any BTC stored on services that are a signatory to this agreement. We have listed the businesses supporting this contentious hard fork at the bottom of this document.
>
>For users who aren’t prepared to install Bitcoin Core and go through the lengthy set up process, we recommend a wallet such as GreenAddress, Electrum or TREZOR. Avoid using web wallets like blockchain.info. However users should only use these wallets to store their coins and never perform transactions until well after the hard fork. Any transactions you make on the Bitcoin blockchain can also be replicated and “replayed” on the altcoin chain. If the coins on the contentious hard fork have any value, there will be methods you can use to “split” your coins and have access to them. Pay extra attention to major Bitcoin communication channels and media shortly after the fork so you stay informed.
>
>**Mobile wallets**
>
>Miners in Bitcoin are responsible for transaction ordering through putting transactions into blocks, and collectively creating a chain of these blocks. Most mobile wallets depend on blindly trusting the longest chain produced by the miners in order to safely send and receive transactions. There is considerable mining power supporting the contentious hard fork. A majority of miners have pledged to support the contentious hard fork, therefore the longest chain as seen by most mobile wallets may not be the true block chain. As a result of this, spending money from a mobile wallet during a hard fork is dangerous. You will be vulnerable to many attacks as your wallet is not aware that the miners are breaking the consensus rules on the longest chain.
>
>If the contentious hard fork has failed and the majority of miners have broken their pledge to support the hard fork, it is safe to continue using mobile wallets, however you should check multiple sources of Bitcoin news such as this website, /r/bitcoin, and the Bitcoin Forum to make sure that it’s safe to continue using your particular wallet. As a general rule, you should not perform any transactions during and shortly after the hard fork.
>
>**After the fork**
>
>Blocks may be slower shortly after the hard fork and your transactions will take longer to confirm. You will have to pay a higher transaction fee if your transaction is high priority and you want it confirmed in the next block. You should try to get any important transactions done a few days before the hard fork date. A lot of websites and programs will likely pop up around the time of the hard fork offering to split your Bitcoin so you can have access to both your BTC and to the new altcoin created by this contentious hard fork, you should exercise caution as many of these services are likely to be scams trying to steal your bitcoin. As the hard fork has very little replay protection, most transactions you perform on the Bitcoin network will also be valid on the hard fork network. You should keep this in mind when transacting.
>
>Some services may continue to present and name the altcoin created by this contentious hard fork as Bitcoin. Users should be aware that this new currency is not Bitcoin. Bitcoin can only be changed with the overwhelming consensus of the entire Bitcoin community of individuals, miners, developers and economy. Even when there is overwhelming consensus, unless in an emergency, a hard fork should have at least a year notice period to give enough time for users to upgrade. This hard fork being adopted by the signatories of this agreement achieves none of these things. It is a rushed and hasty upgrade which only has minority community support and has been thoroughly rejected by users and the technical community. As this new altcoin is not Bitcoin, Bitcoin.org will not list wallets and services that present this altcoin as “Bitcoin” or “BTC” to their users after the hard fork. These services have exited the Bitcoin system in a contentious manner and therefore are no longer useful to our visitors.

The article then lists again all the businesses that are supporting Segwit 2x.

Bitcoin Core Twitter and YouTube personality Richard Heart is allegedly [exposed online as an online spammer](reddit.com/r/btc/comments/79y40b/scammer_alert_you_know_the_narcissist_guy_who/) who trained customers to [send millions of unsolicited emails](https://web.archive.org/web/20070821235025/http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-crypto/2003-05/msg00129.html) per day.

>I don't know how this flew under the radar but this is very interesting. Richard Heart was a nobody just a few short months ago. Literally nobody had heard of him until this year. Then all of a sudden out of nowhere he was someone where he himself claimed he was a "thought leader" and started creating these multi hour long videos where he would do nothing but talk shit about big blockers, talk shit about Bitcoin Cash and pump Core and Blockstream as much as possible...They outed him after discovering his past where he was a HUGE SPAMMER, running scams and hanging with murderers and criminals - I KID YOU NOT. He also has a bunch of fake identities including legit fake passports and fake IDs. This guy is not your run of the mill troll. He is a full on scammer with a shady as fck past!

Richard's [first Bitcoin video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgNh43veB3Q) appeared right after the Bitcoin Cash hardfork and strongly critisized big-blockers while supporting Segwit. He would would go on make several popular videos during the height of the scaling wars invovlving BTC, Segwit 2X, and Bitcoin Cash.

Theymos creates a Github issue titled [*Policy to fight against "miners control Bitcoin" narrative.*](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1904#issue-272347583) He expresses his concern as follows and asks that companies sign a pledge aggreeing that Bitcoin consensus rules are not defined by miners in order to be listed on Bitcoin.org.

>With the S2X nonsense, several companies said that miners control Bitcoin. This belief is one of the most dangerous threats to Bitcoin, since if most people think that, then Bitcoin ends up controlled by only a handful of people.
>
>Although this issue is mentioned in a few places on bitcoin.org, I've been thinking that bitcoin.org should somehow act against this more than it is already. For example, maybe bitcoin.org should require that wallets and services sign a very simple pledge that acknowledges that Bitcoin is not ruled by miners in order to be linked from bitcoin.org.

Hilariously, Cobra replies in agreement and [blames this *misconception* on the white paper itself,](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1904#issuecomment-342973983) which begs the question whether the white paper written by Satoshi Nakamoto is correct or they are. He then proposes the paper be rewritten.

>The whitepaper is to blame for all these dangerous beliefs. We seriously need to rewrite it, or produce a completely new whitepaper and call that the Bitcoin whitepaper.

The proposal appears to be wildly unpopular on Github.

[Steam stops accepting Bitcoin payments citing extreme volatility in fee prices.](https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613)

>In the past few months we've seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network. For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin.

In interview in CoinTelegraph, Bitcoin Core supporter Max Keiser tells people to [use an altcoin, Dash, if they want a payment system.](https://cointelegraph.com/news/steam-stops-accepting-bitcoin-payments-citing-extreme-volatility-fees)

>Dash is emerging as the crypto payment rail while Bitcoin asserts itself as Gold 2.0. I suggest those frustrated by the Bitcoin scaling debate to embrace Dash for payments and leave Bitcoin Core alone to continue working on Gold 2.0.

>Will they also accuse judges and juries of being "retarded" if they rule that the two phrases too similar? 

Pierre had [previously argued](http://archive.is/iVzMs) that disputes over Bitcoin forks should be settled in court, not markets.

[The North American Bitcoin Conference stops accepting Bitcoin due to fees and network congestion.](https://news.bitcoin.com/miami-bitcoin-conference-stops-accepting-bitcoin-due-to-fees-and-congestion/) The organizer Moe Levin told reporters: 

>We wish this was easier, but no ticketing options exist which can handle large volumes of ticket sales, and transaction fees on the Bitcoin blockchain exceed $30 at certain times of the day.

[Stripe ends its support for Bitcoin, citing the block sizes filling up and the lack of utility, and therefore interest, in Bitcoin payments.](https://stripe.com/blog/ending-bitcoin-support) While Stripe states they don't necessarily disagree with the Bitcoin community not raising the block size, they no longer have any reason to work with it.

>Our hope was that Bitcoin could become a universal, decentralized substrate for online transactions and help our customers enable buyers in places that had less credit card penetration or use cases where credit card fees were prohibitive.
>
>Over the past year or two, as block size limits have been reached, Bitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange. Given the overall success that the Bitcoin community has achieved, it’s hard to quibble with the decisions that have been made along the way. (And we’re certainly happy to see any novel, ambitious project do so well.)
>
>This has led to Bitcoin becoming less useful for payments, however. Transaction confirmation times have risen substantially; this, in turn, has led to an increase in the failure rate of transactions denominated in fiat currencies. (By the time the transaction is confirmed, fluctuations in Bitcoin price mean that it’s for the “wrong” amount.) Furthermore, fees have risen a great deal. For a regular Bitcoin transaction, a fee of tens of U.S. dollars is common, making Bitcoin transactions about as expensive as bank wires.
>
>Because of this, we’ve seen the desire from our customers to accept Bitcoin decrease. And of the businesses that are accepting Bitcoin on Stripe, we’ve seen their revenues from Bitcoin decline substantially. Empirically, there are fewer and fewer use cases for which accepting or paying with Bitcoin makes sense.
>
>Therefore, starting today, we are winding down support for Bitcoin payments. Over the next three months we will work with affected Stripe users to ensure a smooth transition before we stop processing Bitcoin transactions on April 23, 2018.

CheapAir CEO Jeff Klee announces their [plans to accept Bitcoin Cash](https://www.cheapair.com/blog/a-letter-to-our-bitcoin-customers/) and other coins [because they offer lower fees and better transaction experiences than Bitcoin.](https://news.bitcoin.com/expedia-drops-bitcoin-payments-official-confirms/)

>In different ways, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Dash all promise improved transactability than their predecessor, with faster transaction times and/or lower fees,” Cheapair noted in a press release. “Over the last six months, we’ve seen a huge uptick in the number of customers requesting alternative currencies, so we’ve worked hard to integrate the three that were most requested.

[CoinMarketCap deletes Bitcoin.com from their BTC listing](https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinmarketcap-quietly-removes-bch-promoting-bitcoincom-from-its-btc-page) as punishment after Bitcoin Core supporters drum up a false effort to accuse them of misleading customers over BTC and BCH.

Bitcoin Core Twitter personalty Ragnar Lifthrasir helped [organize the campaign.](https://twitter.com/Ragnarly/status/990212856820809729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

>If you've lost bitcoin because of misleading language, ticker symbols, graphics, or photos on any Roger Ver website or wallet (like Bitcoin .com) please submit your report to: https://t.co/Tvk2YG4bju we also have a Telegram group.

The problem? Days before CoinMarketCap delisted Bitcoin.com the entire effort had been [dropped because they couldn't get enough supporters](https://cointelegraph.com/news/pro-btc-movement-scraps-lawsuit-against-vers-bitcoincom-citing-lack-of-funds) to say they had been mislead by Bitcoin.com and contribute to the cause.

Popular Bitcoin podcast host, Peter McCormack, asks in r/bitcoin if someone can help him understand both sides of the scaling debate. [His post is immediately deleted.](https://twitter.com/derykmakgill/status/996110493793173504?s=20)

Longtime Bitcoiner [Bryan Micon comments](https://twitter.com/BryanMicon/status/996384902089199616?s=20) in frustration and notes that r/bitcoin has become a bubble:

>Censoring the mere mention of an altcoin, in a legitimate post discussing Bitcoin vs. said altcoin, is what's wrong with r/bitcoin.
>
>Missing the old days where ideas flowed freely there. 
>
>Now it's an echo chamber where wrongthink is quickly swept away.

Blockstream's Chief Strategy Officer Samson Mow asks for an [SEC investigation](https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/976628574919671808?s=20) into CNBC for discussing Bitcoin Cash and jail time.

>Nice selective timeframe to pump the $BCH altcoin to your viewers. May as well make a graphic putting it on a throne for dramatic effect right? Seriously, if these guys at @CNBC aren’t in jail by year end, someone isn’t doing their job.  @SEC_Enforcement

He asks if there are any [current investigations.](https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/998650624370663425?s=20)

>My question is if there are any pending investigations into @CNBCFastMoney by @SEC_News for @BKBrianKelly and other staff pumping and dumping $BCH, or accepting bribes to market the altcoin to investors.

He also [asks for material he can send the SEC directly.](https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/998762417470373888?s=20)

>Collecting some gems for @SEC_Enforcement @SEC_News to take a closer look at @CNBCFastMoney @CNBC pumping and dumping altcoins on their viewers. Enough is enough. If you have more tweets, post below and I’ll add them to the Moment. 

Blockstream 'contractor' and Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr joins in and tells a now-deleted Bitcoin Cash account that [Bitcoin Cashers will be jailed.](https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/976677047589396480?s=20)

Cobra creates a [Github issue proposing to redo the long-standing informational video on Bitcoin.org.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/2535#issue-343348067) From his comment, we can tell his concern is that users would think that Bitcoin is meant to be used for payments.

>...Claims fees are low which is not necessarily true...
>
>Overall the video just feels... empty. Anyone who watches it won't even get close to a true understanding of what Bitcoin is. It just presents Bitcoin as something slightly better than PayPal. I think it's better if we get a new more up to date video made.

It is notable that nobody had ever complained about the video and the impression it left newcomers with about Bitcoin for years.

#### 11 August 2018

Cobra creates a Github issue to discuss [relisting companies that were removed from Bitcoin.org for supporting the 2mb hard fork block size increase.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/2577) His reasoning is that the delisting *worked* to stop the increase and that these companies are unlikely to try it again.

>After the whole S2X situation, we removed links to many of the businesses that had signed the NYA. The site doesn't mention Coinbase, Xapo, BitPay, BTC.com, etc. I think enough time has passed for us to reconsider the situation. The removal and subsequent period of not linking to them was reasonable, since these companies could have attempted another contentious hard fork shortly after S2X failed, but time has shown that they've completely failed and given up at taking over Bitcoin, and are unlikely to try again.
>
>I believe that attacks on Bitcoin through manipulating large economic actors like Coinbase are a thing of the past. 

Theymos [replies and says they should not be relisted](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/2577) unless they publicly apologize and issue a statement on why they were wrong.

>As far as I can tell, if they don't do anything like that again, it'll be because it's become too difficult now, not because they've learned from it. So I wouldn't re-add them unless they admit their mistakes and in particular acknowledge that Bitcoin is not governed, especially not by miners.'

Former Blockstream Cofounder Matt Corallo blocks Samson Mow on Twitter, calling it the "best decision" he's ever made and says ["I'm honestly pretty embarrassed to have helped cofound @Blockstream."](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1133040768531214338)

He strongly crisizes the [troll culture popular at the company.](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1133042374320562177?s=20)

>The kind of "let's be mean just because it's fun" culture exposed by a number of 
@Blockstream folks and their management is a lot of what's wrong with (a small subset) of the Bitcoin culture.

Greg Maxwell [attempts](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Lightning_Network&diff=prev&oldid=930392324) to have Bitcoin XT scrubbed from the Bitcoin Wikipedia page.

>I feel like this subject could get adequately covered as part of a broader article on consensusless decenteralized payment systems, but considering that lightning is the only such system with even moderately wide deployment and that there aren't a lot of secondary sources on the broader idea... that gets in the way of covering it that way.

>Surely you didn't conceal your assets... that would have been extraordinarily unwise considering how widely you have bragged about your holdings, especially considering that the IRS will pay whistleblowers up to 30% of the underpayment when the total under-paid is at least $2m. But if you did disclose your assets you should be on the list?
